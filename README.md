# ECE364_Lab11
Fall 2017 @ Purdue University

This is a Steganography project. It has functionality for embedding payloads into carriers, extracting payloads from carriers, cleaning carriers of any payloads, and possibly more that I have forgotten. I also created (was required to create) a Pyside GUI to facilitate the use of these processes.
